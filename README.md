# nowpy - Run Any Python File Instantly

**nowpy** combines `python`, `venv`, and `pip` to launch a dedicated isolated environment, automatically figure out which packages are required, and then run your Python file - all with just **one** command. 

**nowpy** finds packages by performing a recursive lookup for a `requirements.txt` or a Poetry-flavoured `pyproject.toml`, and cross-checks with any `import` statements inside the Python file. 

**Note**: **nowpy** should find many common packages whose `import` names don't match their PyPI distribution names, such as `import sklearn` -> `pip install scikit-learn`, but the hardcoded list of substitutions is definitely not exhaustive. 

## Installation

Install **nowpy** with `pip` or `pipx`. If you only really run scripts, this might be the last time you ever have to `pip install` anything...

```sh
pip install nowpy
# Even better
pipx install nowpy
```

## Usage

Here's an example of what happens if you run **nowpy** on a Python file that imports `requests`. 

First run:

```sh
nowpy WorldTimeApi.py

**nowpy** creates a unique virtual environment for every directory you run `nowpy` from. It also removes unused ones automatically over time (only five ever exist). But if you ever want to reset the virtual environment in a directory that you're using, just use the `--reset` option:

```sh
nowpy --reset
```

That's all!
 
## Roadmap

- Enable **nowpy** to find packages required by generic `pyproject.toml` files, not just "Poetry-flavoured" ones.
